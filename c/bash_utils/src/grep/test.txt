Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, 
songwriter, and record producer. He is often cited as one of the most influential rappers of his generation. 
Aside from his solo career, he is also a member of the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy alongside his former Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) labelmates Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Schoolboy Q.
Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the stage name K.Dot, releasing 
a mixtape titled Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat Minor of the Year) that garnered local attention and led to his signing with indie record label TDE.[1] He began to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated.
 The following year, he independently released his first studio album, Section.80, which included his
 debut single "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had amassed a large online following and collaborated with several prominent rappers. He subsequently secured a record deal with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment, under the aegis of Interscope Records.
