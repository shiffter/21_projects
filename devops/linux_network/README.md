# Linux Network

Linux networks configuration on virtual machines.

## Part 1. **ipcalc** tool

`-` So, let's start our dive into the wonderful world of networks by getting to know IP addresses. And for that we will use **ipcalc** tool.

**== Task ==**

##### Start a virtual machine (hereafter -- ws1)

#### 1.1. Networks and Masks
##### Define and write in the report:
##### 1) Network address of *192.167.38.54/13*
##### 2) Conversion of the mask *255.255.255.0* to prefix and binary, */15* to normal and binary, *11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000* to normal and prefix
##### 3) Minimum and maximum host in *12.167.38.4* network with masks: */8*, *11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000*, *255.255.254.0* and */4*

#### 1.2. localhost
##### Define and write in the report whether an application running on localhost can be accessed with the following IPs: *194.34.23.100*, *127.0.0.2*, *127.1.0.1*, *128.0.0.1*

#### 1.3. Network ranges and segments
##### Define and write in a report:
##### 1) which of the listed IPs can be used as public and which only as private: *10.0.0.45*, *134.43.0.2*, *192.168.4.2*, *172.20.250.4*, *172.0.2.1*, *192.172.0.1*, *172.68.0.2*, *172.16.255.255*, *10.10.10.10*, *192.169.168.1*
##### 2) which of the listed gateway IP addresses are possible for *10.10.0.0/18* network: *10.0.0.1*, *10.10.0.2*, *10.10.10.10*, *10.10.100.1*, *10.10.1.255*

## Part 2. Static routing between two machines

`-` Now let's figure out how to connect two machines using static routing.

**== Task ==**

##### Start two virtual machines (hereafter -- ws1 and ws2)

##### View existing network interfaces with the `ip a` command
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.
##### Describe the network interface corresponding to the internal network on both machines and set the following addresses and masks: ws1 - *192.168.100.10*, mask */16 *, ws2 - *172.24.116.8*, mask */12*
- Add screenshots of the changed *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file for each machine to the report.
##### Run the `netplan apply` command to restart the network service
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.

#### 2.1. Adding a static route manually
##### Add a static route from one machine to another and back using a
`ip r add` command.
##### Ping the connection between the machines
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used commands to the report.

#### 2.2. Adding a static route with saving
##### Restart the machines
##### Add static route from one machine to another using *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file
- Add screenshots of the changed *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml*
  file to the report.
##### Ping the connection between the machines
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.

## Part 3. **iperf3** utility

`-` Now that we have linked two machines, tell me: What is the most important thing about transferring information between machines?

`-` The connection speed?

`-` That's right. We’ll check it with **iperf3** utility.

**== Task ==**

* In this task you need to use ws1 and ws2 from *Part 2*.

#### 3.1. Connection speed
##### Convert and write results in the report: 8 Mbps to MB/s, 100 MB/s to Kbps, 1 Gbps to Mbps

#### 3.2. **iperf3** utility
##### Measure connection speed between ws1 and ws2
- Add a screenshots with the call and output of the used commands to the report.

## Part 4. Network firewall

`-` After connecting the machines, the next our task is to control the information flowing over the connection. For that we use firewalls.

**== Task ==**

* In this task you need to use ws1 and ws2 from *Part 2*.

#### 4.1. **iptables** utility
##### Create a */etc/firewall.sh* file simulating the firewall on ws1 and ws2:
```shell
#!/bin/sh

# Deleting all the rules in the "filter" table (default).
iptables -F
iptables –X
```
##### The following rules should be added to the file in a row:
##### 1) on ws1 apply a strategy where a deny rule is written at the beginning and an allow rule is written at the end (this applies to points 4 and 5)
##### 2) on ws2 apply a strategy where an allow rule is written at the beginning and a deny rule is written at the end (this applies to points 4 and 5)
##### 3) open access on machines for port 22 (ssh) and port 80 (http)
##### 4) reject *echo reply* (machine must not ping, i.e. there must be a lock on OUTPUT)
##### 5) allow *echo reply* (machine must be pinged)
- Add screenshots of the */etc/firewall* file for each machine to the report.
##### Run the files on both machines with `chmod +x /etc/firewall.sh` and `/etc/firewall.sh` commands.
- Add screenshots of both files running to the report.
- Describe in the report the difference between the strategies used in the first and second files.

#### 4.2. **nmap** utility
##### Use **ping** command to find a machine which is not pinged, then use **nmap** utility to show that the machine host is up
*Check: nmap output should say: `Host is up`*.
- Add screenshots with the call and output of the **ping** and **nmap** commands to the report.

##### Save dumps of the virtual machine images
**p.s. Do not upload dumps to git under any circumstances!**


## Part 5. Static network routing

`-` So far we have only connected two machines, but now it's time for static routing of the whole network.

**== Task ==**

Network: \
<img src="misc/images/part5_network.png" alt="part5_network" width="500"/>

##### Start five virtual machines (3 workstations (ws11, ws21, ws22) and 2 routers (r1, r2))

#### 5.1. Configuration of machine addresses
##### Set up the machine configurations in *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* according to the network in the picture.
- Add screenshots of the *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file for each machine to the report.
##### Restart the network service. If there are no errors, check that the machine address is correct with the `ip -4 a`command. Also ping ws22 from ws21. Similarly ping r1 from ws11.
- Add screenshots with the call and output of the used commands to the report.

#### 5.2. Enabling IP forwarding.
##### To enable IP forwarding, run the following command on the routers:
`sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`.

*With this approach, the forwarding will not work after the system is rebooted.*
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.

##### Open */etc/sysctl.conf* file and add the following line:
`net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`
*With this approach, IP forwarding is enabled permanently.*
- Add a screenshot of the changed */etc/sysctl.conf* file to the report.

#### 5.3. Default route configuration
Here is an example of the `ip r' command output after adding a gateway:
```
default via 10.10.0.1 dev eth0
10.10.0.0/18 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.10.0.2
```

##### Configure the default route (gateway) for the workstations. To do this, add `default` before the router's IP in the configuration file
- Add a screenshot of the *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file to the report.
##### Call `ip r` and show that a route is added to the routing table
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.
##### Ping r2 router from ws11 and show on r2 that the ping is reaching. To do this, use the `tcpdump -tn -i eth1`
command.
- Add screenshots with the call and output of the used commands to the report.

#### 5.4. Adding static routes
##### Add static routes to r1 and r2 in configuration file. Here is an example for r1 route to 10.20.0.0/26:
```shell
# Add description to the end of the eth1 network interface:
- to: 10.20.0.0
  via: 10.100.0.12
```

- Add screenshots of the changed *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file for each router to the report.

##### Call `ip r` and show route tables on both routers. Here is an example of the r1 table:
```
10.100.0.0/16 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.100.0.11
10.20.0.0/26 via 10.100.0.12 dev eth1
10.10.0.0/18 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.10.0.1
```
- Add a screenshot with the call and output of the used command to the report.
##### Run `ip r list 10.10.0.0/[netmask]` and `ip r list 0.0.0.0/0` commands on ws11.
- Add a screenshot with the call and the output of the used commands to the report.
- Explain in the report why a different route other than 0.0.0.0/0 had been selected for 10.10.0.0/\[netmask\] although it could be the default route.

#### 5.5. Making a router list
Here is an example of the **traceroute** utility output after adding a gateway:
```
1 10.10.0.1 0 ms 1 ms 0 ms
2 10.100.0.12 1 ms 0 ms 1 ms
3 10.20.0.10 12 ms 1 ms 3 ms
```
##### Run the `tcpdump -tnv -i eth0` dump command on r1
##### Use **traceroute** utility to list routers in the path from ws11 to ws21
- Add a screenshots with the call and the output of the used commands (tcpdump and traceroute) to the report.
- Based on the output of the dump on r1, explain in the report how path construction works using **traceroute**.

#### 5.6. Using **ICMP** protocol in routing
##### Run on r1 network traffic capture going through eth0 with the
`tcpdump -n -i eth0 icmp` command.

##### Ping a non-existent IP (e.g. *10.30.0.111*) from ws11 with the
`ping -c 1 10.30.0.111` command.
- Add a screenshot with the call and the output of the used commands to the report.

##### Save dumps of the virtual machine images
**p.s. Do not upload dumps to git under any circumstances!**

## Part 6. Dynamic IP configuration using **DHCP**

`-` Our next step is to learn more about **DHCP** service, which you already know.

**== Task ==**

*In this task you need to use virtual machines from Part 5*

##### For r2, configure the **DHCP** service in the */etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf* file:

##### 1) specify the default router address, DNS-server and internal network address. Here is an example of a file for r2:
```shell
subnet 10.100.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {}

subnet 10.20.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.192
{
    range 10.20.0.2 10.20.0.50;
    option routers 10.20.0.1;
    option domain-name-servers 10.20.0.1;
}
```
##### 2) Write `nameserver 8.8.8.8.` in a *resolv.conf* file
- Add screenshots of the changed files to the report.
##### Restart the **DHCP** service with `systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server`. Reboot the ws21 machine with `reboot` and show with `ip a` that it has got an address. Also ping ws22 from ws21.
- Add a screenshot with the call and the output of the used commands to the report.

##### Specify MAC address at ws11 by adding to *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml*:
`macaddress: 10:10:10:10:10:BA`, `dhcp4: true`
- Add a screenshot of the changed *etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml* file to the report.
##### Сonfigure r1 the same way as r2, but make the assignment of addresses strictly linked to the MAC-address (ws11). Run the same tests
- Describe this part in the report the same way as for r2.
##### Request ip address update from ws21
- Add screenshots of ip before and after update to the report
- Describe in the report what **DHCP** server options were used in this point.

## Part 7. **NAT**

**== Task ==**

##### In */etc/apache2/ports.conf* file change the line `Listen 80` to `Listen 0.0.0.0:80`on ws22 and r1, i.e. make the Apache2 server public
- Add a screenshot of the changed file to the report
##### Start the Apache web server with `service apache2 start` command on ws22 and r1
- Add screenshots with the call and the output of the used command to the report.

##### Add the following rules to the firewall, created similarly to the firewall from Part 4, on r2:
##### 1) Delete rules in the filter table - `iptables -F`
##### 2) Delete rules in the "NAT" table - `iptables -F -t nat`
##### 3) Drop all routed packets - `iptables --policy FORWARD DROP`
##### Run the file as in Part 4
##### Check the connection between ws22 and r1 with the `ping` command
*When running the file with these rules, ws22 should not ping from r1*
- Add screenshots with the call and the output of the used command to the report.
##### Add another rule to the file:
##### 4) Allow routing of all **ICMP** protocol packets
##### Run the file as in Part 4
##### Check connection between ws22 and r1 with the `ping` command
*When running the file with these rules, ws22 should ping from r1*
- Add screenshots with the call and the output of the used command to the report.
##### Add two more rules to the file:
##### 5) Enable **SNAT**, which is masquerade all local ip from the local network behind r2 (as defined in Part 5 - network 10.20.0.0)
*Tip: it is worth thinking about routing internal packets as well as external packets with an established connection*
##### 6) Enable **DNAT** on port 8080 of r2 machine and add external network access to the Apache web server running on ws22
*Tip: be aware that when you will try to connect, there will be a new tcp connection for ws22 and port 80
- Add a screenshot of the changed file to the report
##### Run the file as in Part 4
*Before testing it is recommended to disable the **NAT** network interface in VirtualBox (its presence can be checked with `ip a` command), if it is enabled*
##### Check the TCP connection for **SNAT** by connecting from ws22 to the Apache server on r1 with the `telnet [address] [port]` command
##### Check the TCP connection for **DNAT** by connecting from r1 to the Apache server on ws22 with the `telnet` command (address r2 and port 8080)
- Add screenshots with the call and the output of the used commands to the report.

## Part 8. Bonus. Introduction to **SSH Tunnels**

##### Run a firewall on r2 with the rules from Part 7
##### Start the **Apapche** web server on ws22 on localhost only (i.e. in */etc/apache2/ports.conf* file change the line `Listen 80` to `Listen localhost:80`)
##### Use *Local TCP forwarding* from ws21 to ws22 to access the web server on ws22 from ws21
##### Use *Remote TCP forwarding* from ws11 to ws22 to access the web server on ws22 from ws11
##### To check if the connection worked in both of the previous steps, go to a second terminal (e.g. with the Alt + F2) and run the `telnet 127.0.0.1 [local port]` command.
- In the report, describe the commands that you need for doing these 4 steps and add screenshots of their call and output.
