### 21_projects

#### Here are the completed training projects.
##### So far I have explored the following areas

	-Golang
	-C
	-C++
	-DevOps
	-Python

`Python` and `DevOps` are interesting as research and technical expertise.

`C` was studied as the basis of programming and the use of a structured programming style.

`C++` was chosen for learning object oriented programming.

I see the further development of my career in back-end development in the `Go` language.
